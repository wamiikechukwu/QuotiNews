## üìù Requirements üìù

The current project uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) in order to search and provide news information. 
Hence, in order to run this project properly it is necessary to specify such API key in the `local.properties` file, in the following way: 
```groovy
NEWS_API_KEY=029cs8873jd783SomeApiKeyValue
```

These fields are used in the `build.gradle` file from the `app:module` in order to generate `BuildConfig` fields.
```groovy
// Reading the `NEWS_API_KEY` field from local.properties
buildConfigField "String", "API_KEY", "\"${properties.getProperty("NEWS_API_KEY")}\""
```
